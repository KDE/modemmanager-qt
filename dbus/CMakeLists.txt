# Steps to generate the dbus interface files
# 1) Place the ModemManager introspection dbus xml in introspection/
# 2) Update the list of xml files below that we want to generate interfaces for
# 3) Enable dbus subdirectory in ../CMakeLists.txt
#    Make, in order to generate the interface sources
# 3.1) Add annotations to the xml so qdbusxml2cpp knows what type or typedef to use
#      Add typedefs as needed to generic-types.h
# 4)   Add the list of generated files needed for the plugin to FILES_TO_BUILD
# 6) Copy the working generated interface sources into the source dir
# 5) Edit the sources as required to get them to build
# 5.1) Fix the inclusion guards as the compiler ignores anything after a '-' so the compiler thinks
#      headers have already been included
# Run do-hand-edits to update the diff of the interfaces vs what is generated; this speeds up regenerating them since you just have to apply the diff to make them compile
