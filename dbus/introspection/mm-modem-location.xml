      This interface allows devices to provide location information to client
      applications.  Not all devices can provide this information, or even if
      they do, they may not be able to provide it while a data session is
      active.

        Enable or disable location information gathering.  This method may

          When enabling location information gathering, this argument controls
          whether the device emits signals with new location information or not.
          When signals are emitted, any client application (including malicious
          ones!) can listen for location updates unless D-Bus permissions
          restrict these signals from certain users.  If further security is
          desired, this argument can be set to FALSE to disable location
          updates via D-Bus signals and require applications to call
          authenticated APIs (like GetLocation) to get location information.
          This argument is ignored when disabling location information
          gathering.

        <tp:docstring>
          <p>For capability reporting, indicates the device is capable of
          providing GPS NMEA-format location information.</p>

          <p>For location reporting, devices supporting this capability return
          a string containing one or more NMEA sentences (D-Bus signature 's').
          The manager will cache the most recent NMEA sentence of each type for
          a period of time not less than 30 seconds.  When reporting multiple
          NMEA sentences, sentences shall be separated by an ASCII Carriage
          Return and Line Feed (&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;) sequence.
          </p>
          <p>
          For example, if the device sends a $GPRMC sentence immediately
          followed by a $GPGGA sentence, the reported location string would be
          (where of course the &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; is replaced with the actual
          ASCII CR (0x0D) and LF (0x0A) control characters):
          <pre>
          $GPRMC,134523.92,V,,,,,,,030136,,,N*73&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;$GPGGA,,,,,,0,00,0.5,,M,0.0001999,M,0.0000099,0000*45
          </pre>
          If the device sends a new $GPRMC three seconds later, the new $GPRMC
          replaces the previously received $GPRMC sentence, and the updated
          string would be:
          <pre>
          $GPRMC,134526.92,V,,,,,,,030136,,,N*76&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;$GPGGA,,,,,,0,00,0.5,,M,0.0001999,M,0.0000099,0000*45
          </pre>
          If the device then sends a $GPGSA sentence about 5 seconds later, the
          $GPGSA sentence is added to the string (since no $GPGSA sentence was
          previously received in this session), the updated string would be:
          <pre>
          $GPRMC,134526.92,V,,,,,,,030136,,,N*76&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;$GPGGA,,,,,,0,00,0.5,,M,0.0001999,M,0.0000099,0000*45&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;$GPGSA,A,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.1,0.5,1.0*34
          </pre>
          The manager may discard any cached sentences older than 30 seconds.
          </p>
          <p>This allows clients to read the latest positioning data as soon as
          possible after they start, even if the device is not providing
          frequent location data updates.

          <p>For location reporting, devices supporting this
          capability return a string in the format "MCC,MNC,LAC,CI" (without the
          quotes of course) where the following applies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              MCC is the three-digit ITU E.212 Mobile Country Code of the
              network provider to which the mobile is currently registered.
              This value should be the same MCC as reported by the
              org.freedesktop.Modem.Gsm.Network.GetRegistrationInfo() method's
              returned "operator code" argument.
              e.g. "310"
            </li>
            <li>
              MNC is the two- or three-digit GSM Mobile Network Code of the
              network provider to which the mobile is currently registered.
              This value should be the same MCC as reported by the
              org.freedesktop.Modem.Gsm.Network.GetRegistrationInfo() method's
              returned "operator code" argument.
              e.g. "26" or "260"
            </li>
            <li>
              LAC is the two-byte Location Area Code of the base station with
              which the mobile is registered, in upper-case hexadecimal format
              without leading zeros, as specified in 3GPP TS 27.007 section
              10.1.19.  e.g. "84CD".
            </li>
            <li>
              CI is the two- or four-byte Cell Identifier with which the mobile
              is registered, in upper-case hexadecimal format without leading
              zeros, as specified in 3GPP TS 27.007.  e.g. "2BAF" or "D30156".
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The entire string may only be composed of the ASCII digits [0-9],
          the alphabetical characters [A-F], and the comma (,) character.  No
          other characters are allowed.  For example: "310,260,8BE3,2BAF" or
          "250,40,CE00,1CEAD8F0".</p>

          <p>If any of these four items (MCC,MNC,LAC,CI) is unknown or the
          mobile is not registered with a network, then the GSM_LAC_CI location
          information item should not be provided as a returned value from the
          GetLocation() method or in the Location property.</p>
