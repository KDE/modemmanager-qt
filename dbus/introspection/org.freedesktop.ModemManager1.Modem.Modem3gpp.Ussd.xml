      org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Modem.Modem3gpp.Ussd:
      @short_description: The ModemManager 3GPP USSD interface.

      This interface provides access to actions based on the USSD protocol.

    <!--
        Initiate:
        @command: The command to start the USSD session with.
        @reply: The network response to the command which started the USSD session.

        Sends a USSD command string to the network initiating a USSD session.

        When the request is handled by the network, the method returns the
        response or an appropriate error. The network may be awaiting further
        response from the ME after returning from this method and no new command
        can be initiated until this one is cancelled or ended.

        Respond:
        @response: The response to network-initiated USSD command, or a response to a request for further input.
        @reply: The network reply to this response to the network-initiated USSD command. The reply may require further responses.

        Respond to a USSD request that is either initiated by the mobile network,
        or that is awaiting further input after
        <link linkend="gdbus-method-org-freedesktop-ModemManager1-Modem-Modem3gpp-Ussd.Initiate">Initiate()</link>

        Cancel an ongoing USSD session, either mobile or network initiated.

        NetworkNotification:

        When no USSD session is active, or when there is no network-
        initiated request, this property will be a zero-length string.
